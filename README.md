This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Core Functions

1. Sign-in/Sign-up
2. Check current weather conditions(OpenWeatherMap), including UV Index
3. Input Sunlight(outdoors) time and Water intake
4. Feed data into a daily progress(energy) animation
5. Try to reach 100%, daily

## Notes
- Plan to host on Heroku
- Using OpenWeatherMap API
- Possibly 0auth for authentication
- Maybe add streaks for reaching progress goals
- Maybe show previous entries
